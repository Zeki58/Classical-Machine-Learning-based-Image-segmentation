# Classical-Machine-Learning-based-Image-segmentation

The project focused on machine learning for semantic segmentation of Sigma phase particles in High entropy alloys has been  completed. 
Essential guidance and insights were drawn from Dr. Sreenivas Bhattiprolu's GitHub repository, "Python for Microscopists." 
These resources were invaluable during the project's implementation and validation stages, contributing significantly to its unique development and outcomes.
